        The RLA Lab is interested in how the development of synthetic biology can revolutionise biotechnologies and help us to move towards a sustainable bio-based economy. We engineer microorganisms for a wide range of applications which span from the production of the chemicals and fuels we usually get from petroleum to their use in food, biomedicine and therapeutics.
