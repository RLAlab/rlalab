        The **RLA Lab** is interested in how the development of synthetic biology can revolutionise biotechnologies and help us to move towards a sustainable bio-based economy. We engineer microorganisms for a wide range of applications which span from the production of novel foods and alternative proteins to chemicals and fuels.

        The group is interested in using and developing new synthetic biology tools that allow us to precisely manipulate microbial cells in a reliable, predictable and standardised way. In particular, we are interested in those cutting-edge techniques that permit a fine tuning of metabolic pathways.

New Products: Metabolic Engineering for sustainable bioproduction
The manipulation and optimization of microbial metabolic pathways are the keys for biotechnology and a bio-based economy. Our research group is highly interested in hacking metabolism using synthetic biology tools to create new properties and enhanced behaviours in microbial cells. The engineering strategies are not only designed to produce new high-value products or higher amount of pre-existing products but also to facilitate the downstream and upstream parts of the bioprocesses.
The lab is interested in engineering both, conventional (such as S. cerevisiae and E. coli) and non-conventional organisms, including our widely used yeast Y. lipolytica.

New Processes: Synthetic microbial communities for biotechnology 
Microbial communities are important for both industrial bioprocesses (i.e. food production). We are interested in how microbial communities can be engineered and how synthetic biology can help to establish novel communities of microbes which can have applications in biotechnology.

New Knowledge: Understanding phenotypic heterogeneity and how it affects production
The development of single-cell technologies allowed to study how individual cells behave within a population. Such variations affect total bioproduction in a biotechnological process. We are interested in understanding heterogeneity and develop tools to control it in our favour.
