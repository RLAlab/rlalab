        The **RLA Lab** is interested in how the development of synthetic biology can revolutionise biotechnologies and help us to move towards a sustainable bio-based economy. We engineer microorganisms for a wide range of applications which span from the production of novel foods and alternative proteins to chemicals and fuels.
